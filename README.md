# bfInterpreter  
An interpreter for the BrainFuck programming language  
Includes a few example programs written by me.
# Usage
    make  
    ./main file [-d] [-o output file]
options are as follows:  
* -d = debug mode  
* -o = output file  
# output files  
if you would like the interpreter to write to an output file as well as the command line, specify an output file with -o
